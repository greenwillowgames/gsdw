    Plot
  </h2>

  <p>
    <i>Gray Skies, Dark Waters</i> is a folklore-influenced, mystery-driven game that places you in the shoes of Lina Garrett. You’re seventeen years old, and your life revolves around the ordinary in your small Virginia town: acing that trigonometry test, babysitting your younger sisters and brother, and making lists of colleges. Then your mother vanishes, a police investigation turns up nothing, and suddenly your life is the furthest thing from ordinary.
 </p>

<p>
One year later, your family is still reeling. But today, on the anniversary of your mother’s disappearance, you’re going to settle the question of what happened to her once and for all – no matter what you discover along the way. Maybe Vivian Garrett just left. Maybe she died (by her own hand or someone else’s). Or maybe an old folktale about women with supernatural powers is more fact than fiction. Explore the fictional town of Avett’s Landing, set in the Chesapeake Bay area of Virginia, in order to piece together the truth. But bear in mind that truth is a slippery thing, and it will change each time you replay <i>Gray Skies, Dark Waters</i>.
