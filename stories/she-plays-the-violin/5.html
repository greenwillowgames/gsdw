<p>“Maybe I could go to a show with you, some time?” Lina says. “If you want.”</p>

<p>They’re both in bed, slogging through homework with sheets wrapped around their thighs, like the Egyptian cotton might protect them from the boredom of busywork. Lina puts her AP European History textbook down on the floor between their bed frames. “I’ve been thinking about it. What you get out of live shows, I mean. You’ve been going to so many recently.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think you were even interested,” Violet says, glancing up from the laptop balanced on her knees.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t. Until you started going. I can find a babysitter for Gus and Merle if Dad’s not around, and we could head to Richmond one Saturday…” She raises one eyebrow.</p>

<p>Violet’s instinct is to say, <i>I want that time for myself.</i> She’s come to think of her weekends, which she now spends underneath the overheated lights of this or that music club, as the only time she can be alone. Even when Lina’s not in the room they share and Violet has the space (which holds two of everything: two beds, two desks, two lamps, two framed photographs of their mother) to herself, Violet can feel the marks left on the walls of the house by everyone else in the family. No one is really alone here. “I’ll look around for something you might like,” Violet says instead. But her mind is already shying away from the idea.</p>

<p>Lately, even Lina’s been talking to her with the same forced gentleness in her voice, as if at any moment Violet might crack open like an egg. Violet wants to take her sister by the shoulder and say, <i>You’re being too good.</i> In the five months since their mother’s disappearance, Lina’s been the one who makes sure Gus and Merle have yogurt and cereal in the morning. She calls the plumber when the pipes threaten to freeze up, and arranges carpools to get Merle home from soccer practice. Their father is now spending so much time in his research lab that Violet isn’t sure he still qualifies as a resident of their house. She’d like to ask him what he thinks this will solve, and does he understand what this is doing to Lina, but instead Violet wrings out her confusion and bitterness into the miasma of the music.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Lina says. She pauses. “I really want to go, you know. I’m not just asking…because.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” Violet tells her.</p>

<p>They never do go to a show together.</p>
