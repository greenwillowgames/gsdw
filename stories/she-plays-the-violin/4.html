<p>A few days later, Violet goes to her first concert that doesn’t feature violinists playing Schubert and Beethoven. Her friend Sophie takes her to a place in Norfolk, which is an hour’s drive away. Sophie’s brother, who is friends with the bassist of the band they’re going to see, is at the wheel. This is lucky for Violet and Sophie, who still aren’t old enough to drive.</p>

<p>During the drive, Violet stares out the dingy window at the expanse of the bay unfolding next to the highway. Sophie keeps asking her, “Are you sure you want to come to this? Really sure?”</p>

<p>“It’s too late for me to change my mind, even if I wanted to,” Violet says finally.</p>

<p>Sophie is fifteen, but could pass for seventeen because of her orange lipstick and liquid eyeliner that she flicks up at the corners in thick, Amy Winehouse-style lines. She already has three piercings on her right ear, and she’s had beer before. Violet met her three years ago, when Sophie was the best viola player in the middle school orchestra. Now, though, Sophie splits her time between the viola and the electric guitar, and spends weekends traveling to shows in Norfolk and Richmond and Virginia Beach. She isn’t nearly as good on the guitar, but Violet would never tell her that.</p>
