<p>“I’ll have the lavender oil this time,” says Vivian. “Lavender is supposed to relax you, right? I could use the relaxation.” She shrugs off her cardigan – mornings at the Birches are chilly, even in June – and drapes it across the stool next to Miles’s massage table. This is the third day in a row that Vivian has come to the spa where Miles works, and still the sharpness of Vivian’s bare shoulders takes Miles by surprise every time he sees them.</p>

<p>“People say that, I guess,” Miles tells her. “Lavender for relaxation, peppermint for energy. I don’t know about that, but-” He shrugs. “Just pick something you’ll be okay with smelling for the rest of the day.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take the lavender, then.” Vivian gives her a polite smile, and Miles steps into the hallway. He doesn’t bother giving Vivian the usual instructions – <i>undress to your level of comfort, lie face-down underneath the top sheet, note whether the headrest is comfortable, I’ll knock in a few minutes</i> – since he gave them yesterday, and the day before that. No one else is here at 9:00, so Miles inspects the other two treatment rooms, checking for clean sheets on each massage table and shaking bottles of oil to make sure they’re full. Then he knocks on the door to Vivian’s room.</p>

<p>“Come in,” says a muffled voice.</p>

<p>Another thing Miles has noticed about Vivian is her long, dark hair, which spills over the headrest and glints red in the light from the salt crystal lamp. No hint of gray, even though Vivian must be – what – forty-five?</p>

<p>“What’s bothering you this morning?” Miles asks, even though he has a feeling that Vivian will say exactly what she said yesterday: <i>I’m tense everywhere.</i></p>

<p>“I’m tense everywhere,” Vivian says.</p>

<p>“Let’s see what we can do about that.” Miles runs her hands down Vivian’s back, which is so knotted and unforgiving that it practically creaks, like a ship’s hull. Miles learned a long time ago not to compare his clients, but Vivian has some of the tightest muscles he’s ever worked with.</p>

<p>He pulls the sheet away from Vivian’s skin, warms a palmful of lavender-scented oil between his hands, and gets to work.</p>
